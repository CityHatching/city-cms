## Philosophy and Idea
The back-end should be a platform integrated with city planning infrastructure. Ideally, we would fetch 3D models of buildings, information about projects regarding SDGs, integrate the discussion threads with social media, create a more sophisticated admin panel, gamification system, etc. Possibilities are endless and this demo serves as a proof of concept.
